    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the debt service coverage ratio<br> 
    What is the debt service coverage ratio?<br>
    The debt service coverage ratio (DSCA) is the amount of the company's cash flow that is available to pay the current debt obligations and it helps the investors to know if the company has enough income to pay it's debt.<br>
    How to calculate debt service coverage ratio?<br>
    To calculate debt service coverage ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    debt service coverage ratio = net operating income / debt service<br>
    Example: Company x has a net operating income of $400,000 and it also has $270,000 worth of total debt service, calculate the debt service coverage ratio.<br>
    using the debt service coverage ratio formula the answer will be:<br>
    debt service coverage ratio = net operating income / debt service<br>
    debt service coverage ratio = $400,000 / $270,000<br>
    debt service coverage ratio = 1.48<br>
    Why use debt service coverage ratio?<br>
    The debt service coverage ratio is used to measure the firm's capacity to repay it's loans, take on new financing and also to make dividend payments.<br>
